# TRUNK12-VGG
an experiment on using Convulotional Neural Networks as a high level feature extractor and using it in tandem with low level features extractors like Local Binary Patterns and Gabor filters.
(Note that the VGG16 network is pretraind on the Imagenet dataset and only the last layers are trained on TRUNK12)
